# sorting_algorithm_Visualizer


## Overview

This project is an interactive web-based tool designed to visually demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms. It aims to help users understand the mechanics behind different sorting techniques through real-time visualization.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms in action
- Multiple sorting algorithms available:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Dark mode/light mode toggle for comfortable viewing
- Ability to generate new random arrays
- Option to stop the sorting process mid-way

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the "Size" slider to adjust the number of elements in the array.
3. Adjust the "Speed" slider to control the visualization speed.
4. Click "New Array" to generate a random array of the selected size.
5. Choose a sorting algorithm by clicking on its respective button.
6. Watch the visualization of the sorting process in real-time.
7. Use the "Stop Sorting" button to halt the process if needed.
8. Toggle between dark and light modes using the "Toggle Theme" button.

## Technical Details

This project is built using:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for functionality and animations
- Bootstrap 4 for responsive design elements

The visualization is achieved by manipulating DOM elements in real-time, providing a smooth and interactive experience.

## Learning Outcomes

By using this visualizer, you can:
- Observe how different sorting algorithms approach the task of ordering elements
- Compare the efficiency and behavior of various sorting techniques
- Gain insights into algorithm complexity and performance characteristics

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms
- Implement sound effects for a multi-sensory learning experience
- Include algorithm complexity information and comparisons
- Add the ability to input custom arrays

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the visualizer or add new features are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
